Description: This package provides a wrapper for wavelet-based signal estimation that can be made from important 
    packages in R. It also provides a functional for estimating several models  
    that can be specified in each of those important packages. Then, the main goal of the 
    package is to facilitate the use of wavelet signal estimation methods from a 
    single function and build a lot of models to help the choice of the appropriated model.
