Description: This package provides a wrapper for wavelet-based signal estimation from important 
    packages in R and it constructs a functional for estimating several models by combining 
    parameters that can be used in each of those important packages. Then, the main goal of the 
    package is to facilitate the use of several alternatives of wavelet signal estimation from a 
    single function and build a lot of models to facilitate the choice of the appropriated model.
